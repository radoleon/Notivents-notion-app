# Notivents - Notion Event Integration  
> Start of Development: **June 2025**

> [!CAUTION]  
> This project is unfinished, abandoned, and will not be further developed.

### Description ✏️  
This project was intended to be an **event management platform** integrated with **Notion**.  
The main idea was to let organizers manage their events inside Notion (title, date, etc.) and then sync them into a dedicated web application. From here, organizers would be able to share events with participants and enable features such as **RSVP**, **Q&A**, and **reminders**.

The project remains **abandoned** and currently includes partial implementations of:  
- **Authentication** with Supabase (email/password + magic link for guests)  
- **Notion workspace integration** via OAuth  
- **Database syncing logic** (per-month synchronization with manual or scheduled refresh)  
- **Basic event states and transitions** (planned, finished, canceled, not found, removed)  

### Features (Partial) ✨  
- Supabase authentication (email/password and magic link)  
- Role-based access (organizer vs guest, unfinished)  
- Workspace connection with Notion via OAuth  
- Database selection (choose which Notion databases to sync)  
- Monthly event synchronization with resync option  
- Event states: planned, finished, canceled, not found, removed
